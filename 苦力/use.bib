	abstract = {Let A be an m×n matrix with m≥n. Then one form of the singular-value decomposition of A is A=UTΣV,where U and V are orthogonal and Σ is square diagonal. That is, UUT=Irank(A), VVT=Irank(A), U is rank(A)×m, V is rank(A)×n and Σ=σ10⋯000σ2⋯00⋮⋮⋱⋮⋮00⋯σrank(A)−1000⋯0σrank(A)is a rank(A)×rank(A) diagonal matrix. In addition σ1≥σ2≥⋯≥σrank(A){\textgreater}0. The σi’s are called the singular values of A and their number is equal to the rank of A. The ratio σ1/σrank(A) can be regarded as a condition number of the matrix A. It is easily verified that the singular-value decomposition can be also written as A=UTΣV=∑i=1rank(A)σiuiTvi.The matrix uiTvi is the outer product of the i-th row of U with the corresponding row of V. Note that each of these matrices can be stored using only m+n locations rather than mn locations. Using both forms presented above—and following Jerry Uhl’s beautiful approach in the Calculus and Mathematica book series [Matrices, Geometry \& Mathematica, Math Everywhere Inc., 1999]—we show how SVD can be used as a tool for teaching Linear Algebra geometrically, and then apply it in solving least-squares problems and in data compression. In this paper we used the Computer Algebra system Mathematica to present a purely numerical problem. In general, the use of Computer Algebra systems has greatly influenced the teaching of mathematics, allowing students to concentrate on the main ideas and to visualize them.},
